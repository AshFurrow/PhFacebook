PhFacebook is an embeddable MacOSX framework to easily access Facebook's API.

It comes with a sample application to show you how to use it.

It uses Facebook's new 'graph' API internally, handles OAuth in a WebView for you, stores the authentication token securely in the keychain and returns JSON strings.

It also supports extended permissions.

----

A note on the sample application: it requires your Application ID to function properly. The first time you build the application, it will create a (non-versioned) file called ApplicationID.h. 

You must edit this file with your Application ID from this Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/developers/apps.php before the sample app will build.
